# CourseProject

This repository is the final project for the couse Getting and Cleaning Data, by Cousera. It was took in May,2018. 
The main point of this exercise is to get and clean the dataset of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, Version 1.0.


The repository includes the following files:
============================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'CodeBook.txt': Shows information about the variables and summaries calculated

- 'run_analysis.R': Shows how I got the data a how I manipulated it to make it tidy. The objective is to make the steps reproducible.
