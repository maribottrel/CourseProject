This repository is the final project for the couse Getting and Cleaning Data, by Cousera. It was took in May,2018. 
The main point of this exercise is to get and clean the dataset of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

Above is the information of the dataset and how the experiment has been conducted.

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The repository includes the following files:
============================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'CodeBook.txt': Shows information about the variables and summaries calculated

- 'run_analysis.R': Shows how I got the data a how I manipulated it to make it tidy. The objective is to make the steps reproducible.
